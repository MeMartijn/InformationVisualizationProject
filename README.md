# Information Visualization Project: Global Terrorism Database
The code in this repository is aimed at visualizing the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd), taken from the Kaggle. 

> The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2015 (with annual updates planned for the future). The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 150,000 cases. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

This visualization contains a stacked area chart and a world map. The datasets used are derived from the main database, but are edited and/or cleaned using Python.

Our research was conducted by request of the University of Amsterdam's course Information Visualization. This course is part of the [Information Science](http://www.uva.nl/programmas/bachelors/informatiekunde/informatiekunde.html) track.
