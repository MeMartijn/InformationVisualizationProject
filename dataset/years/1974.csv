The two .32 caliber gun shots hit Bambic once at the waist level, and once slightly higher up, hitting his heart.  The 84-year-old Bambic then grabbed the man who shot him in an attempt to fight back, until Bambic finally collapsed to his death on the ground.  The perpetrator, later identified by witnesses as J.C. Simon, ran across the street to a gas station where a Cadillac was waiting for him, with two other men inside.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.

As she was taking clothes out of the dryer, she was approached by a tall, black man who did not hesitate before he shot Holly two times in the back with a .32 caliber gun.  The perpetrators, who were later identified to be J.C. Simon and Manuel Moore, then fled without saying a word, and sped away in Moore's 1969 Cadillac, with Anthony Harris, who was waiting in the car and claims to have not seen the shooting.  Holly, the only white person in the laundromat at the time, died almost instantly from the bullets, one which hit her in the upper back, and the other in her abdomen.  Moore and Simon were charged with Holly's murder.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.

One of the .32 caliber bullets pierced through Wollin's heart, killing him almost instantly.  Wollin was just two blocks from his home.  This incident occurred just a few minutes after the murder of white woman Tana Smith a few streets away.  No indictment other than the charge of conspiracy was brought on this crime, but authorities believe that J.C. Simon and Manuel Moore were responsible for the murder of Wollin, as witness Anthony Harris described.

She responded with the same and then started up the stairs, at which point the man shot McMillian in the back two times with a .32 caliber gun; the first shot passed through her body, and the second hit her spine, paralyzing her from the waist down as she collapsed to the floor.  McMillian survived the attack, but was left paralyzed for the rest of her life.  She was the only one of the Zebra killers' five victims on this night in late January that survived.

As the two were walking up Geary Boulevard nearing Webster, they were passed by a black man, who then turned around and stopped, and then proceeded to shoot both cadets in their backs twice with his .32 caliber gun as they attempted to run.  The two bullets that hit Story, hit her in the waist (missing her spine), causing her to collapse to the ground, and resulting in the third bullet subsequently missing her altogether. Rainwater died, but Story survived the ordeal.  No nearby witnesses, nor Story, were able to identify the perpetrators, but police officers believe this was yet another attack by the Zebra killers.  This was the seventeenth in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims).",1,1,1,2,Zebra killers,1

Anderson asked the man if he had a cigarette, but he kept walking until he suddenly stopped, turned around, pulled out a gun and shot two .32 caliber bullets into Anderson.  As Anderson collapsed to the ground, the man shot Terry White three times.  Both boys were seriously injured, but survived the attack.  Manuel Moore was charged with assault with a deadly weapon for shooting Anderson and White.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.

As Shields was rearranging items in the back of the station wagon to make room for the rug, he was shot three times in the back with a .32 caliber gun.  Although no indictments were brought on this crime other than the charge of conspiracy, authorities believe that witness descriptions of the perpetrator(s)  as could have matched either of three of the Zebra killers.  Additionally, just before Shields and his friend arrived at the rug dealer's home, the rug dealer noticed two African American men in their twenties parked in a car outside her home, but by the time Shields and his friend arrived, the men were gone.
