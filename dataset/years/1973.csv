Upon entering the van, the couples hands were tied with rope, and Richard was clubbed into unconsciousness with a wrench, while one of the perpetrators sexually assaulted Quita.  Quita and Richard were both slashed brutally with a long machete-like blade.  Both were thrown out of the van on the rails of the Southern Pacific tracks, about four and a half miles from Telegraph Hill. Quita was killed by several slashes from the machete-like blade; Richard survived, but was badly mutilated by slashes in his face and he was robbed of his wallet. Two of the perpetrators, Jesse Cooks and Larry Green, were found, charged and in March 1976, convicted for the kidnapping, armed assault, robbery, and murder.  The third perpetrator, Anthony C. Harris, was given immunity at the trial in exchange for his testimony.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.

While she was parking her 1965 Mustang, DeMartini noticed another black man walk up the  man in the double-parked car, and then start walking toward her as she left her car and began to walk to her apartment.

The fourth shot, aimed at her head, missed DeMartini as she collapsed to the ground.  As she yelled, another car then drive toward DeMartini in an attempt to kill her, but she rolled herself under the Mustang to dodge the .32 caliber bullets, and thus survived.  The specific perpetrators of this incident are unknown; however, it is suspected that Larry Green was involved in the incident as witnesses at the scene of the crime provided a car description that matched Green's Dodge Dart.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.
