An hour after the blast, a caller to the New York Post, claiming to be a member of the Armed Forces for Liberation (FALN) claimed responsibility for the attack.  Additionally, a written message was taped to a telephone booth at 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue, about a block away from the hotel, in which FALN stated that the blast was an attempt to protest the appearance of Rafael Hernandez Colon, the Governor of Puerto Rico, who was attending a political fund-raising dinner on the second floor of the hotel to raise funds for his re-election.  The bombing caused minor damage to the hotel, but there were no casualties in the blast.",1,1,1,3,Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional (FALN),0
